We want to be able to connect to the machine via ssh

    # apt-get install openssh-server

    You can now ssh into the vm and work from there.



     $ ssh netscape101@192.168.122.74
    The authenticity of host '192.168.122.74 (192.168.122.74)' can't be established.

    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

     From here on I am assuming you are logged in over ssh on your virtual machine.



     Create hidden service directory and give appropirate permissions:



     netscape101@debianbox:~$ su

I accessed the page http://pyaxoanm3het7xax.onion in Tor Browser Bundle.

Remember the config file, had this line: 
     HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:8000

It tells the HiddenService to listen on port 80. And it redirects any incoming traffic on the tor hidden service address pyaxoanm3het7xax.onion
to port 8000 localhost.  Remember if you setup a Tor Hidden Service to only make your services listening on local host.


You don't want this happening to you: 
http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/2t21wl/use_search_by_fingerprint_to_uncloaks_ssh_servers
https://www.shodan.io/search?query=0d%3A2c%3Ab5%3Aca%3A4f%3Ab6%3A31%3Aa8%3A9e%3A6b%3A1e%3Ac4%3A41%3Ad1%3Ac6%3A89

Basically if you are running ssh on your tor hidden service and somebody runs nmap --script ssh-hostkey, and they search shodan.io for your ssh key fingerprint, then they can get the IP address of the 
machine. Obviously won't work in all cases.
